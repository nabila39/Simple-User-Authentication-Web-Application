# Simple User Authentication Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to log in using a username and password. It uses HTML for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing the login functionality using Promises.

## Features

- Users can enter their username and password to log in.
- The application verifies the credentials using a predefined set of credentials.
- If the credentials match, the user is redirected to a home page.
- If the credentials don't match, an error message is displayed.

## Usage

To use this application:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter the username and password provided in the code (or modify the code to use your own credentials).

4. Click the "Login" button.

5. If the credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the home page. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
